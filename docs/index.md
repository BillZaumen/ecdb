# ECDB

ECDB is a simple database application for sending messages and
calendar appointments to people interested in some event. This
program can be run interactively using a GUI or as a command-line
program. Documentation is provided in two manual pages (for Part 1
and Part 5 of the manual) and can be viewed using the 'man' command.
