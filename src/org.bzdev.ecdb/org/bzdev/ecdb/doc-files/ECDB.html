  <TITLE>Descripton of the ECDB class</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
  The ECDB class provides an API for initializing and manipulating a
relational database representing an event calendar. In addition to
methods that select, insert, update, or delete table entries, ECDB can
generate <A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</A>
appointments and send them via email.  Calendar appointments include
the starting date, starting time, ending date, and ending time for an
event, whether there is some activity before an event and when that
starts, and two optional alarms, with the times set on a per-user
basis.  The class will also send messages with or without calendar
appointments to users to either an email address or to the user's SMS
service.  Each calendar appointment is tagged with fields that allow a
previously sent calendar appointment to be updated.
<P>
  The following tables are provided (the types shown are Java types,
not relational-database types):<A ID="dbtable"></A>
<UL>
   <LI>CountryPrefix. The columns are countryPrefix (an instance of
     {@link java.lang.String}) and label (an instance of
     {@link java.lang.String}).
       The primary key is countryPrefix.
   <LI>Carrier. The columns are carrierID (an int) and carrier (a
       String). The primary key is carrierID.
   <LI>CarrierMap. The columns are countryPrefix (an instance of
       {@link java.lang.String}), carrierID (an int), and idomain (an instance
       of {@link java.lang.String}). The primary key consists of countryPrefix
       and carrierID.
   <LI>CellPhoneEmail. The columns are countryPrefix (an instance of
       {@link java.lang.String}), cellNumber (an instance of {@link
       java.lang.String}), emailAddr (an instance of {@link
       java.lang.String}), and setByCarrier (a boolean). This table is
       used as a cache that maps a cell-phone number to the email
       address of its SMS gateway. The primary key consists of
       countryPrefix and cellNumber.
   <LI>UserInfo. The columns are userID (an int), firstName (an
       instance of {@link java.lang.String}), lastName (an instance of
       {@link java.lang.String}), lastNameFirst (a boolean), title (an
       instance of {@link java.lang.String}), emailAddr (an instance
       of {@link java.lang.String}), countryPrefix (an instance of
       {@link java.lang.String}), cellNumber (an instance of {@link
       java.lang.String}), carrierID (an instance of {@link
       java.lang.String}), and status (an instance of {@link
       java.lang.String}). The primary key is userID.
   <LI>Owner. The columns are ownerID (an int), label
       (an instance of {@link java.lang.String}), summary
       (an instance of {@link java.lang.String}). The primary key is ownerID.
   <LI>PreEventDefault. The columns are userID (an int), ownerID (an int),
       useDefault (a boolean). The primary key consists of userID and
       ownerID.
   <LI>Location. The columns are locationID (an int), label
       (an instance of {@link java.lang.String}), location (an instance of
        {@link java.lang.String}). The primary key is locationID.
   <LI>FirstAlarm. The columns are userID (an int), ownerID (an
       int), locationID (an int), eventTime (an instance of
       {@link java.sql.Time}), weekday (a boolean), alarmTime (an instance of
       {@link java.sql.Time}), forEmail (a boolean), and forPhone (a boolean).
       The primary key consists of userID, ownerID, and locationID.
   <LI>SecondAlarm. The columns are userID (an int), ownerID (an int),
       locationID (an int), offset (an int), forEmail (a boolean), and
       forPhone (a boolean). The primary key consists of userID, ownerID,
       and locationID.
   <LI>Event. The columns are eventID (an int), ownerID (an int),
       label (an instance of {@link java.lang.String}), and
       description (an instance of {@link java.lang.String}). The
       primary key is eventID.
   <LI>EventInstance. The columns are instanceID (an int), eventID (an
       int), locationID (an int) preEventType (an instance of {@link
       java.lang.String}), preEventOffset (a non-negative int),
       startDate (an instance of {@link java.sql.Date}), startTime (an
       instance of {@link java.sql.Time}), endDate (an instance of
       {@link java.sql.Date}), endTime (an instance of {@link
       java.sql.Time}), and status (an instance of {@link
       java.lang.String}). The primary key is instanceID.
   <LI>Series. The columns are seriesID (an int), ownerID (an int),
       and label (an instance of {@link java.lang.String}). The
       primarykey is seriesID.
   <LI>SeriesEventInstances. The columns are seriesID (an int) and
       instanceID (an int). The primary key consists of seriesID and
       instanceID.
   <LI>Attendee. The columns are userID (an int), instanceID (an int),
       attendeeState (an instance of {@link java.lang.String}),
       attendingPreEvent (a boolean), and seriesID (an Integer). The
       columns emailSeqno (an int) and phoneSeqNo (an int) are
       maintained by ECDB so that updates to calendar appointments
       will have an appropriate sequence-number field. The primary key
       consists of userID and instanceID.
 </UL>
 Some of the table have columns that are maintained automatically
using triggers. These are typically timestamps, and are used to
generate unique identifiers and sequence numbers for iCalendar objects.
 <P>
 This database also uses the following roles (there is an option for
whether roles are configured or not):
 <UL>
   <LI>ECADMIN:  SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are granted on
       all tables.
   <LI>ECOWNER: SELECT is granted on all tables. INSERT, UPDATE, and
       DELETE are granted on CellPhoneEmail, Owner, Location, Event,
       EventInstance, Series, SeriesInstance
   <LI>ECUSER: SELECT is granted to all tables. INSERT, UPDATE, and
       DELETE are granted on UnserInf, PreEventDefault, FirstAlarm,
       SecondAlarm, and Attendee.
   <LI>PUBLIC: This is a standard role. SELECT is granted to PUBLIC
       for CountryPrefix, Carrier, and CarrierMap.
   <LI>
