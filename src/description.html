<H2>Description of the ECDB module</H2>
<P>
  This module provides a single package, org.bzdev.ecdb, that provides
an API for initializing and manipulating a relational database
representing an event calendar. In addition to methods that select,
insert, update, or delete table entries, instances of
{@link org.bzdev.ecdb.ECDB} can generate
<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</A>
appointments and send them via email.
<P>
  Calendar appointments include the starting date, starting time,
ending date, and ending time for an event, whether there is some
activity before an event and when that starts, and two optional
alarms, with the times set on a per-user basis.  The class will also
send messages with or without calendar appointments to users to either
an email address or to the user's SMS service.  Each calendar
appointment is tagged with fields that allow a previously sent
calendar appointment to be updated.
<P>
  The database tables can grouped into four categories.  These are
shown in the following four diagrams. In these tables, column names
followed with "(PK)" indicate a primary key, and those whose column
names are followed with "(FK)" denote foreign keys. The types are Java
types, not SQL types. The Java types used, which are useful to document
because of the use of JDBC, are the following:
<UL>
  <LI><B>int</B>. The corresponding SQL type is an integer and the
    column cannot contain null values.
  <LI><B>Integer</B>. The corresponding SQL type is an integer type and
    the column can contain null values.
  <LI><B>boolean</B>. The corresponding SQL type is a boolean and the
    column cannot contain null values
  <LI><B>Boolean</B>. The corresponding SQL type is a boolean and the
    column can contain null values
  <LI><B>String</B>. The corresponding SQL type contains character data.
  <LI><B>Date</B>. The Java type is {@link java.sql.Date} and the SQL
    type is a date.
  <LI><B>Time</B>. The Java type is {@link java.sql.Time} and the SQL
    type is a date.
</UL>
In some diagrams, tables shown in blue (or gray if printed with a black
and white printer) are references to tables from another diagram.
<P>
  The first diagram shows the tables for user data and some tables
used to map cell phone numbers to the email address used by an SMS
gateway provided by the user's wireless carrier:

There is a <A HREF="sql.xml.txt">default implementation</A> of these
tables, represented as a set of Java properties saved in the standard
XML format described in the documentation for the class
{@link java.util.Properties}. Each property's key consists of a
token naming some text, and optionally a token representing a database
implementation, with these keys separated by a period.
The SQL keys are
<UL>
  <LI><B>sqlShutdownState</B>. Some databases throw an error when the
    database is being shut down. This lists the names of these errors.
  <LI><B>init</B>. By default, this property is called once when a database
    is being created. If null, it is ignored. Any SQL statements provided
    by this property will be called at the start of the process of
    creating database.
  <LI><B>initForAuth</B>. By default, this property is called once
    when a database is being created and configured for user
    authorization. If null, it is ignored.
  <LI><B>addUser</B>. The value is a format string for generating an
    SQL statement to add a user, with the user's password, to the
    database. This property is used only if the database was
    configured for user authentication and after the
    <B>initForAuth</B> SQL statement (if any) was executed.
  <LI><B>initForRoles</B>. By default, this property is called once
    when a database is being created and configured to use roles.
    If null, it is ignored.
  <LI><B>hasRoles</B>. This property is an SQL statement that will
    return a non-empty row set if roles have been configured and an
    empty result set otherwise.
  <LI><B>roles</B>. This property is a sequence of SQL statements that
    will define the database roles that ECDB uses. It is not called if
    roles are not being configured.
  <LI><B>hasSchemas</B>. This is called when tables are being created.
    It is an SQL statement that will return a non-empty row set if
    the ECDB schema exists and an empty row set if the schema does not
    exist.  It is used to ensure that an attempt to create the tables
    twice will gracefully abort.
  <LI><B>schemas</B>. This is called when tables are being created. It
    contains an SQL statement that will create ECDB's schema.
  <LI><B>tables</B>. This is called when tables are being created. It
    creates all the tables used by ECDB.
  <LI><B>addCountryPrefixes</B>. This is a sequence of SQL statements
    that initializes the CountryPrefixes table. It is called after
    the tables are created.
  <LI><B>initialCarriers</B>. This is a sequence of SQL statements
    that initializes the Carriers table. It is called after
    the tables are created.
  <LI><B>initialCarrierMap</B>.  This is a sequence of SQL statements
    that initializes the CarrierMap table. It is called after
    the tables are created and after the country prefixes and carriers
    have been added to the database.
  <LI><B>grants</B>. This is is a sequence of SQL statements that
    grants various types of access to tables. It is used as the last
    step in creating ECDB tables and applies only if the database uses
    roles.
</UL>
The SQL keys for manipulating the data base are the following (these

    statement that will add a new row to the attendee table with the
    specified userID and series ID for all matching instances in the
    series-instance table provided that such a row does not already
    exist.
  <LI><B>userfields</B>. This property provides an SQL
    statement that will produce a row set whose columns are
    fullName, emailAddr, countryPrefix, cellNumber, and carrierID for
    a specified user ID. The rows are obtained from the user-info table
    with the full name set to the concatenation (separated by a space)
    of the first and last names, with the name order determined by the
    value in the lastNameFirst column.
  <LI><B>calendarData</B>. This property provides a format string for
    an SQL statement that will produce a row set containing the
    columns userID, ownerID, locationID, instanceID, uid, summary,
    idomain, description, preEventType, preEventOffset, startDate,
    startTime, endDate, endTime, emailSeqno, phoneSeqno, location,
    attendingPreEvent, modtimeO, modtimeL, modtimeE, modTimeL, modtimeA
    createTime, lastEmailTime, lastPhoneTime. The format string contains
    "%s", which will be replaced with a boolean SQL expression  and that
    ends with the token AND.  This boolean expression can use the following
    alias for tables: utbl for the user table, o table for the owner table,
    etable for the event table, itbl for the event-instance table, ltbl
    for the location table, and atbl for the attendee table.
    The createTime column is taken from the attendee table and the
    uid column is the concatenation of utbl.uid, otbl.createTime, etable.
    createTime, and itbl.createTime.  The column idomain is taken from
    the owner table. For the modtime columns, the last characters
    O, L, E, I, and A refer to the owner table, the location table, the
    event table, the instance table, and the attendee table respectively.
  <LI><B>calFirstAlarm</B>. This property provides an SQL
    statement that will produce a row set whose columns are eventTime,
    alarmTime, forEmail, forPhone, modTime given values in the userID,
    ownerID, location ID, weekday columns.
  <LI><B>calSecondAlarm</B>. This property provides an SQL
    statement that will produce a row set whose columns are offset,
    forEmail, forPhone, and modTime given values in the userID, ownerID
    and locationID columns.
  <LI><B>nonAttendees</B>. This property provides a format string for
    an SQL statement that will produce a row set whose single column
    is named userID, and that lists users who are not in a select
    statement that selects users that satisfy constraints provided by
    a WHERE clause.  The "%s" directive in the format string follows
    the token WHERE and must end in the token AND.  It can use the
    aliases utbl, otbl, etbl, itbl, and atbl that refer to the
    user-info table, the owner table, the event table, the
    event-instance table and the attendee table
    respectively. Additional constraints require that rows from these
    tables share the same instance ID, event ID, and owner ID when
    those columns are in multiple tables, and also that the starting
    date for an event instance is less than the current date.
  <LI><B>getInstanceCount</B>. This property provides a format string
    for an SQL statement that will count the number of instance IDs in
    the attendee table given some constraints.  The constraints are
    substituted for "%s" in the format string and must be boolean SQL
    expressions that end with the token "AND". The SQL statement supplies
    the aliases atbl, itbl, etbl, otbl, and ltbl for the attendee table,
    the event-instance table, the event table, the owner table, and the
    location table respectively.
