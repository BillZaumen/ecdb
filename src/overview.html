<B>The ECDB class library</B>
<P>
  This software provides a module and a package, both named
org.bzdev.ecdb, that provides an API for initializing and manipulating
a relational database representing an event calendar. In addition to
methods that select, insert, update, or delete table entries, instances
of {@link org.bzdev.ecdb.ECDB} can generate
<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</A>
appointments and send them via email.
<P>
  There are two additional modules:
<UL>
  <LI><B>org.bzdev.ecdb.dryrun</B>. This module implements the email SPI
    (Service Provider Interface), and shows the messages that would be
    sent by displaying the messages in a browser as a series of HTML
    pages.
  <LI><B>org.bzdev.ecdb.javamail</B>. This module allows the java.mail
    module, whose JAR file is javax.mail.jar, to be used. The  java.mail
    module in turn requires the java.activation module, whose jar file
    is javax.activation.jar.
</UL>
These are not documented because they provide
org.bzdev.ecdb.SMTPAgentSPI.  One may also add modules that provide
org.bzdev.ecdb.CellEmailFinderSPI, which is used to map a cell phone
number (including the country prefix) to the email address for an
email to SMS gateway. ECDB does not provide an implementation of this
SPI: there are Internet-based services that can provide this function
but they are proprietary and typically charge for the use of this
service (some allow free interactive use but use captchas), and may
change at any time.
<P>
  Please see <A HREF="doc-files/description.html">the description</A>
This description includes a more detailed overview of the database
that ECDB uses.
